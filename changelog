    - Thanks to Andreas Stührk for the hints.

  * Internal changes:
    - Move most of the API documentation from the rst files back to the code.
    - Name the extension module as libdiscid._discid and move some bits that
      don't require Cython away.

python-libdiscid (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libdiscid.compat.discid module that provides the same interface as the
    discid module from python-discid. This allows devlopers to write
    applications that work with both python-libdiscid and python-discid
    without much effort.
  * Deprecate libdiscid.DEFAULT_DEVICE in favor of libdiscid.default_device.
    The default device might change one some platforms during the runtime, so
    it shouldn't be a constant.
